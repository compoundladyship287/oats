    ///      callbacks with voice processing off, 0 with it on, same run).
    ///      VPIO takes over the output path the aggregate device is built on,
    ///      so turning it on silently costs the entire "Them" channel.
    ///   2. The input node switches to a 7-channel format. Channel 0 still
    ///      carries real audio, but `AVAudioConverter` renders that layout to
    ///      the analyzer's mono format as pure digital silence, so the "Me"
    ///      channel transcribes nothing either.
    ///
    ///   Echo is instead handled after the fact by `Transcript.withoutEcho()`,
    ///   which is why that dedup is a correctness requirement and not a nicety.

    ///   the reference is the principled long-term answer.
